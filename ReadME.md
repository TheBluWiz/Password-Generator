# Password Generator
## Description
The goal of this Web App is to flexibly generate passwords based off of the requirements of various websites. At launch, this allows a character range of 8 to 128 characters and allows you to select requirements such as upper and lower case characters, numbers, and special characters. I reccomend selecting as many requirements as your website allows and choosing the maximum allowed number of characters to achieve the highest level of security. 

## Tasks
- Built Arrays for each requirement type
- Added logic to prompt errors for unexpected User Input
- Created itterative loops to make an array of available characters based on User requirements
- Created itterative loop to assign random characters to User password string up to specified password length

## Example

## Deployment
The finished website can be found [here](https://thebluwiz.github.io/Password-Generator/).

## Going Forward
If I revisit this, I may add exclusions for specific characters as not ALL special characters work with each site. Would also love to know if there are any other comment requirements I've forgotten that could be included here.
