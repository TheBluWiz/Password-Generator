# Password Generator
## Description
The goal of this WebAPP is to flexibly generate passwords based off of the requirements of various websites. At launch, this allows a character range of 8 to 128 characters, and allows you to select requirements such as upper and lower case characters, numbers, and special characters. I reccomend selecting as many requiremnets as your website reports and choosing the maximum allowed number of characters to achieve the highest level of security. 

## Tasks
- Built Arrays for each requirement type
- Added logic to prompt errors for unexpected User Input
- Created itterative loops to make an array of available characters based on User requirements
- Created itterative loop to assign random characters to User password string up to specified password length
